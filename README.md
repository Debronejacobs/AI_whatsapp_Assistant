# WhatsApp AI Agent 🤖💬

An end-to-end **WhatsApp AI Agent** that enables automated, intelligent conversations directly on WhatsApp — combining cutting-edge AI with a reverse-engineered WhatsApp API.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project bridges WhatsApp with an AI-powered conversational agent, combining:

* **Reverse-Engineered WhatsApp API (TypeScript)**
  Handles WhatsApp messaging, session management, and webhook events.

* **AI Conversation Agent (Python)**
  Powers natural language conversations, leveraging **Gemini AI** for advanced reasoning, context awareness, and multi-turn dialogues.

The system is fully containerized for seamless deployment and scalability.

---

## 🚀 Features

* ✅ Full WhatsApp integration using reverse-engineered API.
* ✅ AI conversations powered by Gemini AI.
* ✅ Modular architecture: decoupled client (TypeScript) and AI agent (Python).
* ✅ Dockerized deployment for rapid setup.
* ✅ Webhook-based communication between components.
